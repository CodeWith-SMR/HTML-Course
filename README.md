## 📌 What is HTML?
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language** and is used to create the **structure** of web pages. It consists of **elements** enclosed within tags that tell the browser how to display content. HTML works alongside **CSS** for styling and **JavaScript** for functionality.

### 🏗️ Basic HTML Structure
Below is an example of a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
